# Python-Private_School-Part_1

Coding Bootcamp project

                    ---Design of a Private School Structure---

# Assume that there are four (4) courses in programming languages: C#, Java, JavaScript and Python.

* Every course has a title, a description and the type of it, Full Time for a 12 weeks morning classes 
  scheme or a Part Time, a 24 weeks afternoon classes scheme.
  For example, the following courses might exist:

# Also, there are Trainers under each course with the following details

1 First Name
2 Last Name
3 Subject

# Also, there are Students under each course with the following details

1 First Name
2 Last Name
3 Date of Birth
4 Tuition Fees

# Also, there are Assignments under each course with the following details

1 Title
2 Description
3 Date of Submission
4 Mark for the Submitted Code
5 Mark for the Oral Mark

# On this PART A, you are required to build a command prompt (shell) application

* The application must ask from the command prompt to input data to all the data structures and it should give the option to add more than one entry at a time.

# If the user decides not to type any data, the program should use dummy data

# Also, your program must be able to output the following:
1 A collection of all the students 
2 A collection of all the trainers 
3 A collection of all the assignments 
4 A collection of all the courses 
5 All the students per course 
6 All the trainers per course 
7 All the assignments per course 
8 All the assignments per student per course
9 A list of students that belong to more than one courses
